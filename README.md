# Raising Rights

A website advocating for youth suffrage and civic engagement, exploring the intersection of voting rights, civic rites of passage, and democratic craftsmanship.

## About the Project

**Raising Rights** presents the case for lowering the voting age and improving democratic participation through three interconnected concepts:

- **Rights** - The fundamental right to vote for all those affected by governance
- **Rites** - Civic rites of passage that build democratic participation
- **Wrights** - Citizens who actively build and strengthen democracy

The site includes:
- The case for youth suffrage, including mathematical arguments for voting at 14

- Responses to common objections
- Resources for civic action and engagement
